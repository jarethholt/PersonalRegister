         * - Their salary.
         * These are encapsulated in the attributes Name and Salary.
         * The relevant methods to expose are:
         * - The constructor for creating employees (Employee);
         * - Ways to get/set the name and salary of existing employees;
         * - A string representation of the employee.
         * The get/set methods are part of the attribute definitions.
         * The string representation is defined by ToString (inherited from Object).
